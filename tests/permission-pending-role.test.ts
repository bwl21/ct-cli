/**
 * Pending ROLE definitions in a `group_role` domain (#120).
 *
 * #106 made "declare a group + a `ct.groupRole` on it in one config" work against a host that lacks
 * the group. The same was NOT true when the missing piece was the ROLE: the resolver only ever
 * considered pending groups, so a `groupRole` naming a `roleDefinition` declared three lines up
 * hard-errored — with a message ("Fix the role name, or pass a numeric id") whose two remedies are
 * both wrong for a shared, multi-host config. Role definitions are per group type and drift easily
 * between two hosts of one instance, which is exactly when this bites.
